# processing-photobooth
Personal photobooth project developed for/with processing on the Raspberry Pi.

Imported libraries:
- ControlP5 for the UI
- GL Video to use a WebCam on the Raspberry Pi
- GifAnimation to create a GIF from several pictures
- CountdownTimer to play with... countdown timers :)

The combined use of all those libraries on a Raspberry Pi context came with a bunch of issues.
That's why I had to find some workarounds and tricks that may look a bit uggly in the code. Sorry for that.
